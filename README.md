Welcome to Miluka, the Dapp to create micro lotteries based on basic games that let people win instant prices that can cash using the stable coin platform token and the native token.
 
## 🎮 The Game

1) One user can start a micro lottery based on token limits (Only a specified range for base values, for example, 1, 2, 5, or 10) then let to define a limit fixed-top price for example 100 X base value.
2) Users can choose the pool that opens and participate until the maximum value is achieved.
3) When the pool top value is achieved the system executes an oracle call to get a random winner and execute the price withdrawal to the winner.
4) winner can cash the money to the stable coin and buy directly to the store associated with the platform and get the product chosen.
5) Tokens are kept and paid to the partner, reducing all the cash management processes and getting discounts and offers.

### 📖 How to Play



## 🛠 Technology

- Game logic is open-source and is an Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity
- Tools and libraries used: Truffle, Openzeppelin, NodeJS, Bootstrap

## 🚀‍ Development

### Prerequisites
- Node v10.5.0
- Solidity v0.5.0
- Truffle v5.0.7

### Setup
- Clone the git repo  
- Have a local blockchain running on port 8545 (e.g. using [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache))
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
- Open up your browser and the project should be up on localhost:3000

### Contract interaction on a local blockchain
- Ensure your browser has a plugin (e.g. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)) that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain
- Ensure you have a local blockchain running (e.g. on Ganache)
- Select *Localhost:8545* or *Custom RPC* depending on which port your Ganache blockchain is running on
- Interact with the web interface

## ✅ Testing
- You can run the tests by running `truffle test` from the Goalify main directory
